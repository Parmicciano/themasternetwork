## What is the masternetwork ?
The masternetwork is a platform that connects computing power with developers in exchange for cryptocurrency.
If you do not use a server supporting virtualization, a rasberry pi, you can make it available to the platform.
Thus, depending on the demand, your server will be able to run virtual machines for others and you will receive cryptocurrencies according to the computing power used
How to start a virtual machine ?
Starting a virtual machine is very fast and it will be delivered within minutes if there are enough nodes available.
## How to create a node ?
It's easy to setup, just check the installation page

## What is the currency ?
We use monero, it's a private, decentralized cryptocurrency.
In order to fill your account with monero, you have to send monero to one of our subadress that is asign to you (you can collect it in your profile section). If you send monero, we will see that there is a new transaction and that will allow us to fill your account.
We would like, later, to add many others crypto currencies such as solana, bitcoin, ethereum.
We take a 30% commission between the node and the users.
Need help ?
We will be happy to help you on our discord

## And ...
The user interface is open source on github, feel free to improve it. All the actions you perform in the interface are available to be used directly with your api key @ api.masternetwork.dev
