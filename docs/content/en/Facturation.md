## Facturation model
You pay per use, that is to say that as soon as you use a vm, you will be debited periodically.

You may have noticed that our prices are in US dollars. This means that since your account has a monero balance, at the time of the periodic payment (every 30 minutes), your balance will be converted into US dollars according to coinmarketcap prices (we use coinmarketcap api to get the closest prices to reality). Your balance will be debited as if it were with FIAT currency.

However, if your balance is zero, your instances will be stopped because you will not pay the network anymore. To restart them, you just have to send monero to your account and restart each instance you want to restart. You can of course withdraw your cryptocurrency at any time. You do not pay for the instances when they are stopped.
