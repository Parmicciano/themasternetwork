## How can i improve the masternetwork ?
The site, the user interface is open source. This means that anyone can try to improve it to make the experience more interesting for everyone. It is made with nuxtjs (vuejs) and is just an aesthetic way to interact with the api. <br><br>
So you can add features, make the design more beautiful, better and submit your changes. If approved, they will be deployed quickly, allowing everyone to enjoy them.

## The masternetwork is mainly an api

The api is very sensitive and protected, so if you want to make changes it will be necessary to let us know on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/NVvvkXMbAB">discord</a> which will allow us to provide you with an environment and possibly a part of the revenues of the masternetwork during a given period.
<br><br>
It could be great to add features like CDNs, a specialized cloud for storage, things like that. 
Make the user experience simple, like Netlify did for websites.
The network right now is just the beginning, you can easily add things on top of what is already built. 

## The documentation
If you want to write content, for documentation, tutorials ... It's totally possible ! This could help to make the masternetwork known to more people and you will be able to earn commissions on the expenses of new subscribers. If you are interested, join us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/NVvvkXMbAB">discord</a> and we will be happy to discuss. 
It could be great to create tutorials on how to manage masternetwork infrastructures, create websites, mail servers, start complex applications...
At this moment, the documentation is not free access since I don't want the google robots to index the github pages which will be over the real documentation (as the domain is very recent). <br><br>
So, if you want to improve the documentation, thank you very much, and then, just ask us for the github repository access. We'll give you access immediately!
