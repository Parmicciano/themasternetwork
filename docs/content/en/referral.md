## Refer a user
Refer a user and you will earn 5% of that user's spend for life. This way you can earn monero, without running any nodes or anything, just by bringing a client to the network.


## How much will I earn by sponsoring a masternetwork member?
You will be able to earn 5% of the amount that the referred member spends on the platform. This can be a lot of money if the member uses it regularly. 


## How do I sponsor a user?
You can sponsor a member by using a link.
Your link must be of the following form:
<code-block active>

  ```bash
https://masternetwork.dev/auth/signup/?sponsor=MYAPIKEY
  ```

</code-block>
Your api key is available in your account and the revenue generated when your sponsored users start spending will come directly to your account. You can withdraw the entire amount at any time.
The user can also be sponsored by entering your api key in his interface.
